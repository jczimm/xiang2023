    "text": "My broad research interests include modeling how individuals perceive, represent, and judge potential collaborators’ affordances for collaboration. Xiang, Vélez & Gershman (2023) propose and empirically validate a probabilistic model in which recursively updated inferences of competence and effort (“belief–desire–competence framework”), together with observed outcomes, jointly predict individuals’ judgments of collaborators, across various cognitive tasks which are common within collaboration. In particular, in Experiment 1, their model best predicts participants’ judgments about whether joint activity will succeed, compared to plausible alternative models. I am eager to attempt to replicate this finding to help establish the robustness of this model of collaborator judgment, before I may attempt to extend it in future work.\nExperiment 1 involves observing contestants try to lift a heavy box in a set of contests (six total), each containing three rounds. In each contest, there are two unique avatars playing as the contestants. In rounds 1 and 2, each contestant attempts to lift the box by themselves. In round 3, the contestants attempt to lift the box together. In each round, after observing each contestant succeed or fail to lift the box, the participant judges the strength of each contestant (1–10), and for each contestant that successfully lifted the box, the participant judges that contestant’s allocated effort (0%–100%). At the start of round 2, the participant judges each contestant’s probability of lifting the box successfully (0%–100%), prior to observing the lift attempts. At the start of round 3, the participant judges the probability that the contestants will successfully lift the box together. Further, an incentive to the contestants for lifting the box is specified in each round: in the second and third rounds, the specified reward for lifting the box is double that of the first round. Participants are also told that the heavy box had a constant weight across all contests, which effectively requires at least 5 strength points applied (e.g., on average, 100% effort for a contestant with strength 5, or 50% effort for a contestant with strength 10, etc.). Last, participants see a progressively filled-out table of all the lift outcomes during each contest, visible throughout, including when making judgments.\n\n\n\nExample illustrations shown during instructions; note that the incentive displayed for round 1 is $10, not $20.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn example table for a contest, as it would appear during the probability judgment at the beginning of round 3.\n\n\nThe challenges/opportunities for my learning in this replication project will include: 1) recreating the paper’s proposed (joint effort) model and two alternative (solitary/compensatory effort) models of the probability of joint success in Memo (based on the authors’ pre-existing implementations in WebPPL), and 2) running these models over my newly collected data to attempt to replicate that the proposed model is most predictive of participants’ judgments.

Considerations of feasibility for selecting planned sample size.\n\n\nPlanned Sample\nPlanned sample size and/or termination rule, sampling frame, known demographics if any, preselection rules if any.\n\n\nMaterials\nAll materials - can quote directly from original article - just put the text in quotations and note that this was followed precisely. Or, quote directly and just point out exceptions to what was described in the original article.\n\n\nProcedure\nCan quote directly from original article - just put the text in quotations and note that this was followed precisely. Or, quote directly and just point out exceptions to what was described in the original article.\n\n\nAnalysis Plan\nCan also quote directly, though it is less often spelled out effectively for an analysis strategy section. The key is to report an analysis strategy that is as close to the original - data cleaning rules, data exclusion rules, covariates, etc. - as possible.\nClarify key analysis of interest here You can also pre-specify additional analyses you plan to do.\n\n\nDifferences from Original Study\nExplicitly describe known differences in sample, setting, procedure, and analysis plan from original study. The goal, of course, is to minimize those differences, but differences will inevitably occur. Also, note whether such differences are anticipated to make a difference based on claims in the original article or subsequent published research on the conditions for obtaining the effect.\n\n\nMethods Addendum (Post Data Collection)\nYou can comment this section out prior to final report with data collection.\n\nActual Sample\nSample size, demographics, data exclusions based on rules spelled out in analysis plan\n\n\nDifferences from pre-data collection methods plan\nAny differences from what was described as the original plan, or “none”."

None of these need to be long."
