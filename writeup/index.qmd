<!-- Replication reports should all use this template to standardize reporting across projects.  These reports will be public supplementary materials that accompany the summary report(s) of the aggregate results. -->

## Introduction

<!-- [No abstract is needed.]  Each replication project will have a straightforward, no frills report of the study and results.  These reports will be publicly available as supplementary material for the aggregate report(s) of the project as a whole.  Also, to maximize project integrity, the intro and methods will be written and critiqued in advance of data collection.  Introductions can be just 1-2 paragraphs clarifying the main idea of the original study, the target finding for replication, and any other essential information. You will likely contact the authors of the original study, so this should be professional and forward facing. It will NOT have a literature review -- that is in the original publication. You can write both the introduction and the methods in past tense.   -->

<!--
**From canvas assignment:**
- A short justification for your choice of experiment in terms of your research interests or research program (1 paragraph). This justification should tell us why you chose this particular result. (2 points)
- A description of the stimuli and procedures that will be required to conduct this experiment, and what the challenges will be (1-2 paragraphs). (2 points) -->

My broad research interests include modeling how individuals perceive, represent, and judge potential collaborators' affordances for collaboration. Xiang, Vélez & Gershman (2023) propose and empirically validate a probabilistic model in which recursively updated inferences of competence and effort ("belief–desire–competence framework"), together with observed outcomes, jointly predict individuals' judgments of collaborators, across various cognitive tasks which are common within collaboration. In particular, in Experiment 1, their model best predicts participants' judgments about whether joint activity will succeed, compared to plausible alternative models. I am eager to attempt to replicate this finding to help establish the robustness of this model of collaborator judgment, before I may attempt to extend it in future work.

Experiment 1 involves observing contestants try to lift a heavy box in a set of _contests_ (six total), each containing three _rounds_. In each contest, there are two unique avatars playing as the _contestants_. In rounds 1 and 2, each contestant attempts to lift the box by themselves. In round 3, the contestants attempt to lift the box together. In each round, after observing each contestant succeed or fail to lift the box, the participant judges the strength of each contestant (1–10), and for each contestant that successfully lifted the box, the participant judges that contestant's allocated effort (0%–100%). At the start of round 2, the participant judges each contestant's probability of lifting the box successfully (0%–100%), prior to observing the lift attempts. At the start of round 3, the participant judges the probability that the contestants will successfully lift the box together. Further, an incentive to the contestants for lifting the box is specified in each round: in the second and third rounds, the specified reward for lifting the box is double that of the first round. Participants are also told that the heavy box had a constant weight across all contests, which effectively requires at least 5 strength points applied (e.g., on average, 100% effort for a contestant with strength 5, or 50% effort for a contestant with strength 10, etc.). Last, participants see a progressively filled-out table of all the lift outcomes during each contest, visible throughout, including when making judgments.

The challenges/opportunities for my learning in this replication project will include getting acquainted with the `rwebppl` interface for probabilistic programming using WebPPL (with which I am familiar), running the paper's proposed and alternative computational models over my new collected data, and interpreting and comparing the models' results. I will also replace the original authors' data-saving step (a php page) with [DataPipe](https://pipe.jspsych.org/).

Beyond replication, I will also extend the paradigm in some way. For example, I might make the task more immersive (e.g., by animating the lift attempts, and making the cover-story more fictionalized), and clear (e.g., revising the instructions for clarity). I may also consider modifications that make the judgments non-numerical (to mitigate a potential confound in which, for some combinations of competence and effort, the minimal effort required to lift the box is harder to compute mentally). Upon further theoretical exploration, I may also attempt to incorporate judgment reaction times into my probabilistic model.

## Methods

### Power Analysis

Original effect size, power analysis for samples to achieve 80%, 90%, 95% power to detect that effect size.  Considerations of feasibility for selecting planned sample size.

### Planned Sample

Planned sample size and/or termination rule, sampling frame, known demographics if any, preselection rules if any.

### Materials

All materials - can quote directly from original article - just put the text in quotations and note that this was followed precisely.  Or, quote directly and just point out exceptions to what was described in the original article.

### Procedure	

Can quote directly from original article - just put the text in quotations and note that this was followed precisely.  Or, quote directly and just point out exceptions to what was described in the original article.

### Analysis Plan

Can also quote directly, though it is less often spelled out effectively for an analysis strategy section.  The key is to report an analysis strategy that is as close to the original - data cleaning rules, data exclusion rules, covariates, etc. - as possible.  

**Clarify key analysis of interest here**  You can also pre-specify additional analyses you plan to do.

### Differences from Original Study

Explicitly describe known differences in sample, setting, procedure, and analysis plan from original study.  The goal, of course, is to minimize those differences, but differences will inevitably occur.  Also, note whether such differences are anticipated to make a difference based on claims in the original article or subsequent published research on the conditions for obtaining the effect.

### Methods Addendum (Post Data Collection)

You can comment this section out prior to final report with data collection.

#### Actual Sample
  Sample size, demographics, data exclusions based on rules spelled out in analysis plan

#### Differences from pre-data collection methods plan
  Any differences from what was described as the original plan, or “none”.


## Results


### Data preparation

Data preparation following the analysis plan.
	
```{r include=F}
### Data Preparation

#### Load Relevant Libraries and Functions

#### Import data

#### Data exclusion / filtering

#### Prepare data for analysis - create columns etc.
```

### Confirmatory analysis

The analyses as specified in the analysis plan.  

*Side-by-side graph with original graph is ideal here*

### Exploratory analyses

Any follow-up analyses desired (not required).  

## Discussion

### Summary of Replication Attempt

Open the discussion section with a paragraph summarizing the primary result from the confirmatory analysis and the assessment of whether it replicated, partially replicated, or failed to replicate the original result.  

### Commentary

Add open-ended commentary (if any) reflecting (a) insights from follow-up exploratory analysis, (b) assessment of the meaning of the replication (or not) - e.g., for a failure to replicate, are the differences between original and present study ones that definitely, plausibly, or are unlikely to have been moderators of the result, and (c) discussion of any objections or challenges raised by the current and original authors about the replication attempt.  None of these need to be long.
